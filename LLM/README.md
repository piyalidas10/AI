# Ways an LLM Can Generate Answers
### 1️⃣ Pure Generation (Pretrained Knowledge)
**No external data**

How it works
  -  Uses only what the model learned during training
  -  No database, no retrieval

Flow
```
Prompt → LLM → Answer
```

Example
```
“What is polymorphism in OOP?”
```

✅ Fast  
❌ Knowledge may be outdated  
❌ No private/company data  

### 2️⃣ System Prompt / Instruction Conditioning
**Behavior control, not new knowledge**

How it works
  -  System prompt defines how the model should respond
  -  Still uses internal knowledge

Flow
```
System Instructions + User Question → LLM → Controlled Answer
```

Example
```
“Answer like a senior Angular architect in bullet points.”
```

✅ Controls tone, format, depth  
❌ Does not add new facts  

### 3️⃣ Few-Shot / In-Context Learning
**Learning from examples inside the prompt**

How it works
  -  You give examples
  -  Model follows the pattern

Flow
```
Examples + Question → LLM → Pattern-based Answer
```

Example
```
Q: 2+2 → A: 4
Q: 3+3 → A: 6
Q: 4+4 → ?
```

✅ Powerful without training  
❌ Limited by context length  

### 4️⃣ Tool / Function Calling
**LLM + external tools (but not RAG)**

How it works
  -  LLM decides to call a tool (API, DB query, calculator)
  -  Uses result to generate answer

Flow
```
Prompt → LLM → Tool Call → Result → LLM → Answer
```

Example
  -  Weather API
  -  SQL query
  -  Math calculator

✅ Real-time data  
❌ Requires engineering setup  

### 5️⃣ Fine-Tuned Models
**Model weights are changed**

How it works
  -  Model is trained further on domain-specific data
  -  Knowledge becomes “baked in”

Flow
```
Fine-Tuned LLM → Answer
```

Example
  -  Legal LLM
  -  Medical LLM
  -  Customer support LLM

✅ Consistent answers   
❌ Expensive  
❌ Hard to update knowledge  

### 6️⃣ Memory-Augmented Generation (Session / Long-Term Memory)
**Uses conversation or stored memory**

How it works
  -  Past interactions are injected into prompt
  -  Not retrieval search like RAG

Flow
```
Conversation Memory → LLM → Answer
```

Example
```
“Use the tech stack we discussed earlier.”
```

✅ Personalized  
❌ Context size limits  

### 7️⃣ Hybrid (Most Real Systems)
**Combination of multiple methods**

How it works
  -  System prompt
  -  Few-shot examples
  -  Tool calls
  -  RAG
  -  Memory

Flow
```
Instructions + Memory + Tools + (Optional RAG) → LLM → Answer
```

✅ Enterprise-grade  
✅ Most accurate  
❌ Complex  

| Method          | External Data | Changes Model?  | Common Use        |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Pure Generation | ❌           | ❌              | General Q&A       |
| System Prompt   | ❌           | ❌              | Control output    |
| Few-Shot        | ❌           | ❌              | Pattern learning  |
| Tool Calling    | ✅           | ❌              | Live data         |
| Fine-Tuning     | ❌           | ✅              | Domain expertise  |
| Memory          | ⚠️           | ❌              | Personalization   |
| RAG             | ✅           | ❌              | Private knowledge |
