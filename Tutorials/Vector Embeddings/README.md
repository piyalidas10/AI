# 🔹 What Are Embeddings?

Ollama Embedding : https://ollama.com/search?c=embedding

> Embeddings convert text → numerical vectors.

Example:
```
"I love Kolkata cuisine"
→ [0.021, -0.994, 0.332, ... 768 dimensions]
```

These vectors:
  -  Capture semantic meaning
  -  Allow similarity search
  -  Are used in vector databases (like Qdrant, Weaviate)

## 🔹 What are Embedding Models ?
Embedding models take text, images, or other data and transform them into numerical representations. These numbers capture the essential meaning of the data, allowing machines to understand it better.

Think of it like this: Imagine a dictionary that translates words into unique codes. Embedding models do something similar, but instead of single words, they code complex ideas and relationships.

**Benefits of Embeddings:**  
  -  Semantic Search: Find similar data based on meaning, not just keywords.
  -  Machine Learning: Improve model performance by feeding it meaningful numerical data.
  -  Dimensionality Reduction: Simplify complex data for faster processing.

**Available Embedding Models Online:**  
There are many options available, here are a few resources to get you started:  
  -  Hugging Face: [Hugging Face Embeddings] offers pre-trained models for text and code.
  -  OpenAI API: [OpenAI Embeddings] provides text embedding models with adjustable size for performance optimization.

## 🔹 What is Nomic Embedding?

Nomic AI created a popular open-source embedding model.    
Nomic embeddings which are heavily used in RAG systems, vector search, semantic search, and retrieval pipelines.    
Nomic embeddings (nomic-embed-text) are a specific, high-performance, open-source model designed for long-context text encoding, often outperforming proprietary models like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002.

  -  **Performance**: Specifically, nomic-embed-text is noted for superior performance on both short and long context tasks compared to older OpenAI models.
  -  **Key Features**: It is a 137M parameter, open-source model designed for high-performance RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
  -  **Context Window**: Supports a very large context length (up to 8192 tokens).
  -  **Usage**: Nomic provides specific task types (e.g., search_query, search_document, classification, clustering) to optimize for different NLP tasks.

One common model:
  -  nomic-embed-text
  -  768 dimensions
  -  Very good semantic performance
  -  Works great with RAG

You can use it via:
  -  Ollama
  -  HuggingFace
  -  Direct API

## Text embeddings vs Nomic embeddings

Nomic embeddings (nomic-embed-text) are a specific, high-performance, open-source model designed for long-context text encoding, often outperforming proprietary models like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002.     
Text embeddings are the broader category of converting text into numerical vectors, while Nomic specializes in better, faster, and open-source alternatives for retrieval and semantic search.

**Nomic Embeddings**  
  -  Performance: Specifically, **nomic-embed-text** is noted for superior performance on both short and long context tasks compared to older OpenAI models.
        - nomic-embed-text-v1 with Qdrant : https://qdrant.tech/documentation/embeddings/nomic/
        - ollama : https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text
  -  Key Features: It is a 137M parameter, open-source model designed for high-performance RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
  -  Context Window: Supports a very large context length (up to 8192 tokens).
  -  Usage: Nomic provides specific task types (e.g., search_query, search_document, classification, clustering) to optimize for different NLP tasks. 

**Text Embeddings (General Concept)**  
  -  Definition: Numerical representations of text (words, sentences, documents) as vectors of real-valued numbers.
  -  Purpose: They map text into a high-dimensional space where vectors that are close together have similar meanings.
  -  Use Cases: Semantic search, classification, clustering, sentiment analysis, and recommendation systems.
  -  Examples: OpenAI text-embedding-3, BERT-based models, nomic-embed-text, OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002. 

Key Differences
  -  Performance: Nomic aims to outperform standard, often proprietary, text embeddings.
  -  Accessibility: Nomic is open-source and often more cost-effective compared to closed, API-driven text embeddings.
  -  Focus: Nomic is tailored heavily towards Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and handling large documents.


## 🔹 Can You Use Different LLMs with Same Embedding?

YES ✅

Example:
  - Embedding: nomic-embed-text
  - LLM:
    - Llama 3
    - Mistral
    - Phi-3

Embedding model and LLM are independent. That’s a very important architecture principle.

## Why use Same Embedding Model for Converting your Documents into Vectors and Convert the Query into a Vector??????????
When we say:
```
“Query vector generated by the same embedding model”
```
It means:

> 👉 The model used to convert your documents into vectors must be the exact same model used to convert the query into a vector.

**🔎 Why is this important?**  
Because embeddings create a vector space.

If you use different embedding models:
  -  The vector meanings change
  -  Dimensions may change (768 vs 1536 etc.)
  -  The coordinate system changes
  -  Similarity comparison becomes invalid ❌

It’s like:
  -  Storing locations in GPS coordinates
  -  But searching using a different map system

They won’t align.

**Step 1: Store Documents**

Using embedding model Model A  

Document:
```
"Fast car"
```
Converted to:
```
[0.12, -0.89, 0.44, ...]
```
Stored in vector DB.

**Step 2: User Query**

User asks:
```
"Sports vehicle"
```
Now if you use:

**✅ Same Model A**
  -  It converts to a vector in the SAME mathematical space.
  -  Distance calculation works correctly.

**❌ Different Model B**

It produces:
  -  Different dimension size
  -  Different scaling
  -  Different semantic mapping
Now similarity math becomes meaningless.

**🔬 Technical Reason**

Embedding model defines:
  -  Vector dimension size
  -  Meaning encoding logic
  -  Tokenization strategy
  -  Vector distribution pattern

Changing model = changing geometry of space.

Similarity search only works if:
```
All vectors live in same vector space.
```

**📊 Real Production Rule**

When building RAG system:  
✔ Pick embedding model  
✔ Use it for:  
  -  Document indexing
  -  Query embedding

❌ Never mix embedding models inside same vector collection.
