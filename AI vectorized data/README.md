AI vectorized data (embeddings) is stored in specialized vector databases or systems with vector search capabilities, such as Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate, Qdrant, or ChromaDB. These solutions enable high-speed semantic similarity searches for AI applications. They are also integrated into traditional databases like Oracle, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.
