<summary><strong>What is AI ? How many types of AI ?</strong></summary>
AI is a computer program that can do things that normally require a human mind. This includes things like learning, recognizing patterns, understanding language, and making decisions.

This is the classic way to think about AI's "level of intelligence."

1️⃣ Types of AI based on Capability
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**🔹 1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)**  
👉 Built to do one specific task really well.

Examples
  -  Chatbots likes ChatGPT
  -  Voice Assistants: Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant understanding your speech.
  -  Face recognition : Facebook recognizing faces in your photos.
  -  Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon): Netflix suggesting shows, Spotify creating Discover Weekly.
  -  Voice assistants (Alexa, Siri)
  -  Spam Filters: Your email client learning to detect junk mail.
  -  Navigation: Google Maps predicting traffic and optimizing your route.

**🔹 2. General AI (Strong AI)**   
👉 Can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across any intellectual task a human can.

Abilities
  -  Understand context
  -  Transfer knowledge between tasks
  -  Learn autonomously
  -  Theoretical Example: A robot that can cook breakfast, have a philosophical conversation, then learn to fix a car—all with common sense.

> 🚫 Does not exist yet (still theoretical)

**🔹 3. Super AI**  
👉 Intelligence that surpasses humans in every aspect. Self-improving, potentially incomprehensible to humans.

Examples (fictional)
  -  Skynet
  -  Jarvis (Iron Man)
  -  ⚠️ Purely hypothetical & sci-fi for now
  -  Theoretical Example: An AI that solves climate change, cures all diseases, and invents physics beyond our understanding.

2️⃣ Types of AI based on Functionality
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**🔹 1. Reactive Machines**  
👉 No memory, no learning from past  
Example : IBM's Deep Blue (chess computer), basic spam filters.

**🔹 2. Limited Memory AI**  
👉 Uses past data to make decisions  
Examples : Self-driving cars, Chatbots, Recommendation engines  
✅ Most modern AI falls here

**🔹 3. Theory of Mind AI**  
👉 Understands emotions, beliefs, intentions  
🧠 Still in research phase

**🔹 4. Self-Aware AI**  
👉 Conscious, self-reflective  
🚫 Doesn’t exist. This would be a form of AGI/ASI.  
Example: A robot that knows it's a robot and has desires.

3️⃣ Types of AI based on Technology / Approach
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**🔹 1. Machine Learning (ML) - AI that learns from data.**  
  -  Supervised Learning: Learns from labeled data (cat/not cat photos)
  -  Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data (customer segmentation)
  -  Reinforcement Learning: Learns by trial and error with rewards (AlphaGo)
  -  Semi-supervised Learning: Mix of labeled and unlabeled data

**🔹 2. Deep Learning (DL) - ML using neural networks**
  -  Image recognition
  -  Speech recognition
  -  LLMs
  -  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): For images/video
  -  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): For sequential data (time series, text)
  -  Transformers: The architecture behind ChatGPT (processes all data at once)
  -  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Generate realistic fake data

**🔹 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Understands human language**
  -  Translation
  -  Chatbots
  -  Sentiment analysis

**🔹 4. Computer Vision - Interprets images & videos**
  -  Face detection
  -  OCR
  -  Medical imaging

**🔹 5. Generative AI 🔥 - Creates new content**
  -  Text (ChatGPT)
  -  Images (DALL·E)
  -  Code (Copilot)

**🔹 6. Robotics: AI in physical machines** 
  -  Boston Dynamics robots

**🔹 7. Discriminative AI - Classifies or distinguishes between things**  
  -  Spam filters
  -  facial recognition
  -  medical diagnosis AI

**🔹 8. Predictive AI - Forecasts future outcomes**
  -  Stock prediction
  -  weather forecasting
  -  demand planning
